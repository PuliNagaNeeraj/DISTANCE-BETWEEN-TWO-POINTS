# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 

Import the math module

### Step 2: 

Define the coordinates of the two points

### Step 3:  

Calculate the difference in x and y coordinates

### Step 4: 

Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)

### Step 5: 

Print the use of distance value

### PROGRAM:
```
#Program to find the distance between two points.
import math
x1,y1=10,6
x2,y2=4,2
distance=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
